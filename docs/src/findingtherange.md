## the rational milieu

A rational value has two integer-valued components, the numerator and the denominator. Arithmetic with rational values applies conventional operations to rational values; usually arithmetic is performed with two rational values, and calculation proceeds. 

`p = a/b; q = c/d; r = p + q = a/b + c/d;`
