## using FastRationals

`FastRationals` exports two types: `FastRational{Int32}`, `FastRational{Int64}` with their short forms `FastQ32`, `FastQ64`.

FastRationals are intended for use with _smaller_ rational values.  To compare two rationals or to calculate the sum, difference, product, or ratio of two rationals requires pairwise multiplication of the constituents of one by the constituents of the other.  Whether or not it overflow depends on the number of leading zeros (`leading_zeros`) in the binary representation of the absolute value of the numerator and the denominator given with each rational.  

Of the numerator and denominator, we really want whichever is the larger in magnitude from each value used in an arithmetic op. These values determine whether or not their product may be formed without overflow. That is important to know. It is alright to work as though there is a possiblity of overflow where in fact no overflow will occur.  It is not alright to work as though there is no possiblity of overflow where in fact overflow will occur.  In the first instance, some unnecessary yet unharmful effort is extended.  In the second instance, an overflow error stops the computation.

#### `mayoverflow(rational, rational)`

```julia
bitsof(::Type{T}) where {T} = sizeof(T) * 8

maxmag(q::Rational{T}) where {T} = max(abs(q.num), abs(q.den))  # q.den != typemin(T)
magzeros(q::Rational{T}) where {T} = leading_zeros(maxmag(q))
maxbits(q::Rational{T}) where {T} = bitsof(T) - leading_zeros(maxmag(q))
maxbits(q1::Rational{T}, q2::Rational{T}) where {T} = maxbits(q1) + maxbits(q2)

mayoverflow(q1::Rational{T}, q2::Rational{T}) where {T} = bitsof(T) <= maxbits(q1, q2)
mayoverflow(q1::Rational{T}, q2::Rational{T}) where {T} = bitsof(T) >= magzeros(q1) + magzeros(q2)
```

### working with rational ranges

FastRationals are at their most performant where overflow is absent or uncommon.  And vice versa: where overflow happens frequently, FastRationals have no intrinsic advantage.  How do we know what range of rational values are desireable?  A good place to start is to work with rational quantities that, paired `!mayoverflow(q1, q2)`.  As it is the nature of rational arithmetic to generate increasingly larger denominators, it makes sense to further constrain the working range.  These tables provide some guidance.

## performance relative to system rationals


With appropriately ranged rationals, arithmetic sequences run 12x..16x faster and matrix ops run about 2x..6x faster.

#### actual results

The code that generates these results is available in the `benchmarks` directory, run this file:
[relative_speedup.jl](https://github.com/JeffreySarnoff/FastRationals.jl/blob/master/benchmarks/relative_speedup.jl).
You are welcome to submit a PR with the results of your benchmarking.  There is a file dedicated to this:
[results.md](https://github.com/JeffreySarnoff/FastRationals.jl/blob/master/benchmarks/results.md).

- polynomial deg is 4
- matrix size is 4x4

### differences from system rationals

- There is no `FastRational` representation for Infinity
- There is no support for comparing a `FastRational` with NaN

#### enhanced rounding

`FastRationals` support two kinds of directed rounding, one maintains type, the other yields an integer.
- all rounding modes are available
    - `RoundNearest`, `RoundUp`, `RoundDown`, `RoundToZero`, `RoundFromZero`
```
> q = FastQ32(22, 7)
(3//1, 3//1)

> round(q), round(q, RoundNearest), round(-q), round(-q, RoundNearest)
(3//1, 3//1, -3//1, -3//1)

> round(q, RoundToZero), round(q, RoundFromZero), round(-q, RoundToZero), round(-q, RoundFromZero)
(3//1, 4//1, -3//1, -4//1)

> round(q, RoundDown), round(q, RoundUp), round(-q, RoundDown), round(-q, RoundUp)
(3//1, 4//1, -4//1, -3//1)


> round(Integer, q, RoundUp), typeof(round(Integer, q, RoundUp))
4, Int32

> round(Int16, -q, RoundUp), typeof(round(Int16, -q, RoundUp))
-3, Int16
```
