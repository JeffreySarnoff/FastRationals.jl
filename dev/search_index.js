    "text": "A rational value has two integer-valued components, the numerator and the denominator. Usually, rational arithmetic is applied to two values at a time.  muladd is applied to three rational values.  Here are *, + and muladd for rationals.(a/b * c/d) == (a * c) / (b * d)\n\n(a/b + c/d) == ((a * d) + (b * c)) / (b * d)\n\n(a/b * c/d) + s/t == ((a * c * t) + (b * d * s)) / (b * d * t)Without loss of generality, assume these are values of type Rational{Int32}.  We know each numerator and each denominator hold signed integer values stored in 32 bits.  One bit of an Int32 is used to keep the sign, so there are 31 bits available to hold a magnitude. <sup>ùì™</sup>   The maximum magnitude available is typemax(T), here typemax(Int32) == 2_147_483_647. This value becomes more meaningful when seen in hexadecimal (0x7fffffff), and to understand that, look at the first part in binary (0x7f == 0b0111_1111).  typemax(T) is an initial zero bit followed entirely by one bits, whenever T is built-in signed integer type.Why does it matter?  Multiplication of two of these component values will overflow unless there are enough leading zero bits available within those values.  The product of two B bit Signed system types cannot overflow when there are more than B+1 leading zero bits between the two values being multiplied. This is a sufficient characterization, and I prefer to work with a modicum of slack. The actual implementation uses B+2 to allow for results that obtain from adding two products, and keeping that slack. <sup>ùíÉ</sup><sup><a name=\"usefulfiction\">ùì™</a></sup> Actual Int32 quantities are kept as two\'s complement values, not sign+magnitude.<sup><a name=\"assumption1\">ùíÉ</a></sup> We have quietly assumed both are nonnegative values."

    "text": "To allow computational advantage ‚Äì to procure performance that is absent from the system rationals ‚Äì we elevate a smaller range of magnitudes as preferred. With that, we presuppose and presume that this set of numerators aor denominators is that which pervades the rational values that are used within a computation.  This is not to require that all calculations resolve values that belong to this intially distinguished range.  This does strongly encourage most calculations to so resolve .. or not to stray too far away therefrom.  The entirety of this \"stateless way\" is given therewith. We may proceed with any calculation in this rational arithmetic by applying compensatory logic advantageously; we harvest the predeliction for, and liklihood of working with smaller rational values."

    "text": "Managing the resolution of overflow is an expensive incursion into the overall performance of the computational flow.  To the exent that we may proceed secure in the fact that our next calculation cannot overflow, we have at hand the opportunity to accelerate throughput.  By preferring a more coarse rational map, we lessen encounters with overflow and so augment performant paths.  In general terms, this is the technology that provides the greatly enhanced performance of this FastRational."
